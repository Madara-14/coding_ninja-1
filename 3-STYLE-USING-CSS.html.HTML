  Our sanctuary is acutely aware of the dangers that come along with privately owning big cats like tigers, lions, jaguars, cheetahs, leopards, and cougars. Many of the animals who have found a permanent home at Black Pine Animal Sanctuary were victims of abuse and ill-treatment from private owners and roadside “zoos”.

  Thousands of big cats are being kept in captivity across the United States. These are wild animals that can’t be domesticated and pose a serious threat when improperly kept by private owners.
  
  According to the Animal Welfare Institute, there have been at least 400 dangerous incidents since 1990 that involve captive big cats in 46 states. Five children and 20 adults have lost their lives while others have lost limbs and suffered traumatic injuries.</p>
